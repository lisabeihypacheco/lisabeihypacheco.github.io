I have been an organiser of the EEE Progamme in the LSE Economics Department and STICERD since the 2022/2023 AY. As part of the EEE Programme I help organise the weekly EEE Hour seminar for PhD students and faculty in the Department, as well as co-chair the EEE Programme's two yearly conferences (LSE Environment Week and LSE Environment Camp).
