Hello!

I am an Economics PhD Candidate at the London School of Economics. I work on energy and environment topics in developing countries, using tools from industrial organisation, labour and and international trade.

I will be going on the Economics Job Market in 2025/26.

This is my favourite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarK/).
